Overview
--------

The oTree Virtual Machine Image (OVMI) and oTree Virtual Machine Manager (OVMM)
are two pieces of software which facilitate working with oTree.

`OVMI`_ is targeted at all users of oTree and enables the user to launch an
oTree experiment without having the hassle of keeping all components and
dependencies together. In addition to that the image offers graphical
interfaces for users which are not accustomed to using the command line and
need a slower transition.

In contrast to that `OVMM`_ is directed at server administrators of research labs.
After the server is set up with OVMI and OVMM is installed, the administrator
can quickly create, delete, backup accounts for experimenters where all the
routines are reduced to one command. In the background, OVMM will take care of
the network configuration.
