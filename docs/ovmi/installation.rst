Installation
============

The following steps will guide you through the installation process and at the
end you are able to run your experiment in OMVI.

VirtualBox
----------

The first component we need to install is Oracle's VirtualBox. This piece of
software lets you run the OS inside the virtual machine on your computer.

First, go to `download page`_ and click on the link belonging to your operating
system. The setup file will be downloaded.

You can download the image from the cloud servers of University of Bonn by
following this `download link`_.

.. _download link: https://uni-bonn.sciebo.de/index.php/s/0W9NFn2WfFSidx6

Note that you download a ZIP archive with a size of approximately 10GB. Make
sure that you have enough space available on your machine.

After the download, you need to unzip the folder which requires additional 11GB
of space. The extraction is easily done within the context menu.
