Introduction
============

The oTree Virtual Machine Image (OVMI) is targeted at all users of oTree and
enables the user to launch an oTree experiment without having the hassle of
keeping all components and dependencies together. In addition to that the image
offers graphical interfaces for users which are not accustomed to using the
command line and need a slower transition.

This image is based on technology called virtual machines which allows to
encapsulate an operating system (OS, e.g. Windows, Mac or Linux) and run it on
every other OS. In our case the image is based on Linux. The reason why we use
this technology is that some of the components for oTree like a database to
save the experimental data is not easily installed on every OS.

To get your oTree experiment running, we will guide you through the following
steps in :ref:`ovmi_installation`:

1. Install VirtualBox (the software to run virtual machine images)
2. Download OVMI
3. Run OVMI
