Introduction
============

OVMM is directed at server administrators of research labs. After the server is
set up with OVMI and OVMM is installed, the administrator can quickly create,
delete, backup accounts for experimenters where all the routines are reduced to
one command. In the background, OVMM will take care of the network
configuration.
